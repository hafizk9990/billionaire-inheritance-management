## Automating Inheritance Management Via Smart Contracts
Following is the detailed description of my first-ever smart contract implemented using very humble and basic knowledge of Solidity (contract-oriented language) on Ethereum (a gen-2 blockchain network)

### Scenario
It is the year 2035, and an Australian billionaire, Jason L. Clark, has been diagnosed with stage-5 liver cancer. Doctors have given him 2 to 4 more months to live. He knows his rich inheritance, if not managed and distributed properly after he passes away, can cause distress to many who are in serious need of it. The billionaire wants to know beforehand what will happen to his wealth when he dies

After giving it a lot of thought, he converts all his liquid and non-liquid assets to crypto money, defines some rules, regulations and custom policies about his total fortune of US $6 billion and hires me to program his will into an Ethereum smart contract, so that his inheritance management can be automated through the blockchain network after his death, which is expected any time soon, as the cancer is eating on his liver very ferociously

### Family Background & Lifestyle
The billionaire has 2 kids, viz. Jennifer and Ryan. They go to junior high and high school, respectively. Moreover, Jason has a wife, Anna, whom he loves very much. Besides this, Jason considers The Novo Nordisk Foundation, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and The Wellcome Trust to be a part of his own family, as he regularly supports these organizations in their noble cause by making generous annual donations to them

### Project Use Cases
* We give the money off to kids when their life stage is updated by their mother on the smart contract. Every stage has a specific financial allowance pre-defined and hardcoaded

* We have to do annual charity to all three foundations

* When a kid graduates, 12.5% of Jason's total wealth will be transferred to them. In this sense, both of them get 25% of Jason's wealth, collectively, but only after their graduation. When all the kids graduate, 25% of Jason's total assets should go to his wife. The remaining should be distributed equally among the three charity foundations

### Use Cases Implementation Details
---- Add here implementation details later ----

### Future Extension Plans
This smart contract may / may not be extended and connected in the future with a front-end client app, i.e., a decentralized web application. In case it is extended and connected, the code for the decentralized website will be pushed in another repository, and the link to the repository will be added down below. If there is no link down below, and this is the last statement in the readme file, it means the project has not been extended and taken up further
